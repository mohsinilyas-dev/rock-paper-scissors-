### Implementation Details

The `RPS.py` file contains a `player` function designed to accept a string input representing the opponent's previous move ("R", "P", or "S"). The function is expected to return a string indicating its next move ("R", "P", or "S").

In the first round of a match, the `player` function receives an empty string, as no previous moves exist.

The `RPS.py` file provides a sample function for you to modify. This function is defined with two parameters: `player(prev_play, opponent_history=[])`. Although the second parameter is optional and not used when the function is called, it is included to enable state persistence between consecutive calls, allowing you to track the opponentâ€™s move history. The `opponent_history` parameter is only necessary if you wish to record the opponent's moves.

### Development

Please refrain from modifying `RPS_game.py`. All code changes should be made within `RPS.py`. For testing purposes, utilize `main.py`, which imports the game function and bots from `RPS_game.py`.

To test, use the `play` function, which requires the following four arguments:

- Two player functions to compete against each other
- The number of games to be played in the match
- An optional argument to log each game (set to `True` for detailed output)

For example, to simulate a match where `player` competes against `quincy` for 1,000 games with detailed logging, use:

```python
play(player, quincy, 1000, verbose=True)
```

### Testing

Unit tests are provided in `test_module.py` and are imported into `main.py` for convenience. To automatically run the tests whenever you execute `python main.py`, simply uncomment the last line in `main.py`.
